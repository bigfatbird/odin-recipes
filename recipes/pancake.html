    <h3>Sunday mornings are for pancakes with blueberries</h3>
    <p>Pancakes are a type of flatbread prepared from a batter that is baked on a hot griddle or frying pan. They exist in several variations in many different local cuisines. Most pancakes are quick breads, although some are also made using a yeast-raised or fermented batter. Here are some basic pancake recipes. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>120 g (½ cup or 4 oz) all-purpose flour (white, whole grain or 1:1 mix of white and whole grain)</li>
      <li>1 ½ tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>250 ml (1 cup or 8 fl oz) milk (substitute buttermilk or 1:1 mix of milk and buttermilk)</li>
      <li>1 egg, separated</li>
      <li>1 tbsp white sugar (Optional: this will add a sweetness to your pancakes and is recommended if you are not using any sauces, syrups or ingredient such as bananas or blueberries that will add natural sugars to the mix).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, mix dry ingredients together until well-blended.</li>
      <li>Add milk and mix well until smooth.</li>
      <li>Separate the egg, placing the whites in a medium bowl and the yolks in the batter. Mix well.</li>
      <li>Beat whites until stiff and then fold into batter gently (skip this step for heavier pancakes or if 1 cup buttermilk is substituted for milk).</li>
      <li>Pour ladles of the mixture into a non-stick pan, one at a time.</li>
      <li>Cook until the edges are dry and bubbles appear on surface. Flip; cook until golden. Yields 12 to 14 pancakes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes, tips, and variations</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Serve with butter, maple syrup, fruit, chocolate spread, melted chocolate, jam or cheese.</li>
      <li>Many variations of this recipe use a beaten egg. In these variations most commonly all wet ingredients are mixed together with the dry ingredients in step 2, and you then proceed to step 5.</li>
      <li>Use buttermilk or yogurt instead of milk, or wholegrain flours instead of white. This will change the consistency of the final product (i.e. whole grain flours generally lead to a denser heavier pancake, so try mixing white and wheat in various proportions as suggested above to get the feel you want).</li>
      <li>Add sliced fruit such as banana and apple, or broken crispy bacon to the batter after pouring into the skillet and before flipping.</li>
    </ol>
