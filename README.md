## Assignment:

Basically the task was to create a little recipe site for three of your favorite dishes.
It uses plain HTML at the moment and really isn't that impressive if you know web development,
but might get prettier in the future.

The task is to create a little landing page which lists your favorite recipes and
links to them. You also need to upload pictures of the recipes.

Learning outcome:

* Work with git
* Use simple HTML Structure and organize files for a website
* research recipes to list on a website
* Deploy your website on a server
